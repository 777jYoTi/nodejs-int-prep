    <h1>DAY ONE</h1>
    <h3>
        Q1. What is node.js ?
    </h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        * Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. 

        * It allows running JavaScript code outside the browser, making it great 
          for server-side applications.

        *  Key features: asynchronous, non-blocking, 
                         NPM for package management, 
                         cross-platform, 
                         ideal for real-time apps, 
                         and command-line tools.
    </pre>


    <h2>
      CROSS QUESTIONS ;-
   </h2>
   <h4>No-1 :- Open-Source Cross-Platform: </h4>
   <pre>
        * Open-source refers to software that comes with its source code freely available to the public. 
          This means that anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code.

        * Cross-platform means that the software can run on multiple operating systems, like
          Windows, macOS, or Linux, without needing major changes.

        * So, when we say "open-source cross-platform," it means the software is freely available,
          and it can work on different types of computers.
   </pre>
   <h4>No-2 :- Blocking vs. Non-Blocking: </h4>
   <pre>
        *Blocking: When something is blocking, it means that a task or operation makes the program 
                   wait until it's finished before moving on to the next task.
        
        *Non-Blocking: On the other hand, non-blocking means that a task or operation allows 
                       the program to continue with other things while waiting for a certain task to complete.
   </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Q2. What is NPM ?</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        * NPM is called the "Node Package Manager".

        * It allows installing packages, handling dependencies, and publishing 
          packages for others to use.

        * developers manage and share JavaScript code libraries easily.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Q3. What are the modules in Node.js?</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
         * Modules are reusable blocks of code and functionality that use in our project .

         * It can be easily imported and used in other parts of a Node.js application.

         * Three types Modules :- Core Modules: These are built-in modules that come bundled with Node.js.

                                  Local Modules: These are custom modules created by developers.

                                  Third-party Modules: These are external modules developed by the Node.
    </pre>
    <h2>
      CROSS QUESTIONS ;-
   </h2>
    <h4>No-1 :- What is EXPORT, IMPORT, REQUIRE Keyword? </h4>

    <pre>
         * EXPORT is used to make things available for other modules to use.

             EX:
             const myFunction = () => {};
             const myVariable = 42;
            
             module.exports = {
              myFunction,
              myVariable,
            };

         * IMPORT is not a direct keyword but is  using the 
           REQUIRE function to import functionality from other modules.

           EX:
           const myModule = require('./myModule');

           myModule.myFunction();
           console.log(myModule.myVariable);

         * REQUIRE is used to include external modules or libraries into your Node.js code, 
           allowing you to access their functionality.

           EX:
           const fs = require('fs'); Node.js module 'fs'
           const express = require('express'); 'express'
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Q4.What is the purpose of the module.exports?</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
      * The module.exports object serves as a path between 
        different modules, allowing them to share functionality and data 
        with each other.

      *  It define what should be exported from the module and made available for other 
         parts of the application that require the module.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Q5. Difference between default export and named export</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
      * Default Export:
                       A module can have only one default export.
					   
                       It is used when a module wants to export a 
					             single value or function as its default export.
					   
                       When another module imports the default export, 
			                 it can choose to give it any name during the import.
      *  Named Export: 
                      A module can have multiple named exports.
                      
                      It is used when a module wants to export multiple 
					           functions, objects, or variables from the same file, 
					           and each of them can be accessed individually in the 
					           importing module.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Q6.How do you import any module in Node.js</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
      * In Node.js, you can import modules using the require function.
      * The require function is built into Node.js and allows you to load modules 
        into your application, making their functionality available for use.

        EX :- const fs = require('fs');
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Q7. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
      * HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
                                           1: HTTP is commonly used for websites that do not 
                                              handle sensitive information or where security 
                                           2: Due to the lack of encryption, information HTTP is
                                              allows having security threats like data theft and tampering.
                                              
      * HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
                                           1: HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP.
                                           2: Due to heavy encryption, information HTTP is
                                              making it difficult for hackers to tamper with the data.

    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        * It designed to help developers build backend applications easily and efficiently.

        * It provides a set of tools and features that simplify the process of handling web requests and building APIs.

        * Advantages of using Express:
                                     1. Simple and Lightweight: Express has a minimalistic and straightforward design, making it easy to learn and use. 

                                     2. Middleware Support: Express comes with a vast collection of middleware that can be easily integrated into applications.

    <h3>Q9. What are the different types of HTTP requests?</h3>
    <h4>Ans. Basicaly we use this requests</h4>
    <pre>
        1. GET: Used to retrieve data from a server; a read-only request.

        2. POST: Used to send data to a server to create or update resources.

        3. PUT: Used to update existing resources on the server.

        4. DELETE: Used to remove a resource from the server.
        
        5. PATCH: Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
